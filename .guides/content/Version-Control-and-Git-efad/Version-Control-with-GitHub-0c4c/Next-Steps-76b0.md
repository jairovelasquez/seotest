Congratulations on reaching the end of Week 1 in your game development journey! As you move forward, it’s essential to solidify your project’s foundation. 

This includes finalizing your planning, setting up a collaborative work environment, and preparing for the first sprint of development. 

Follow the guide below to ensure your team is fully prepared for next week.

### Milestones

Before progressing, ensure you've achieved the following milestones:

- **Team Formation and Roles Assigned**: Each member knows their role and responsibilities.
- **Game Concept Agreement**: The team has agreed on a game concept that integrates gameplay and audio.
- **Initial Game Design Document (GDD) Draft**: Your game’s vision is documented, outlining concept, mechanics, story, art, and audio.
- **Project Repository Setup**: A GitHub repository for your project has been created and is accessible by all team members.

### Setting Up Your Project Repository

A version control system like Git, combined with GitHub, is critical for team collaboration. Here’s how to ensure your repository is set up for success.

#### Step 1: Create and Share the GitHub Repository

1. **Create the Repository**: One team member creates a new GitHub repository named after your project. Initialize it with a README, `.gitignore` (Python), and a license if needed.
2. **Share Access**: Add all team members as collaborators through the repository settings.

#### Step 2: Clone and Prepare the Repository Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**: Each team member clones the repository to their local machine.
2. **Prepare the Development Environment**: Set up Python, Pygame, EarSketch, and any other necessary tools.
3. **Establish an Initial File Structure**: Create a basic structure (e.g., `main.py`, `docs/`, `assets/`) and push it to the repository.

#### Step 3: Verify Team Setup

- **Verify Access and Setup**: Ensure all team members can access the repository, push changes, and have their development environment ready.

### Planning for Next Week

- **Discuss any obstacles** encountered during Week 1 and how they were (or will be) overcome.
- **Outline your first development sprint**: What are the primary goals for next week? How will tasks be divided among team members?
- **Schedule a kickoff meeting** for next week to align on objectives, tasks, and ensure a smooth start to development.

Completing these steps ensures that your team is not just ready but also confident to embark on the phase of development.
