**Git** is a distributed version control system commonly used to help development teams collaborate on projects and track changes over time. 

The core component of Git is the **repository**. This is the area where code and related files and directories are stored and their versions are managed. Git allows each person working on the project to keep a copy of the entire directories in version history in a **repository** and store it locally, on their machines, or in a central storage location, like GitHub.

With Git, we can store snapshots or checkpoints of our project, called **commits**, and leave messages about what happened at each of these different points. This series of commits ultimately becomes our version history outlining changes to our project.

We can also make **branches** of a project, allowing us to make different copies of our project that we can work on independent of the original branch. When we make changes in our new unique branch, the main branch stays the same.

We can then bring the branches into sync by **merging** them and reflecting all changes across all **branches**.
