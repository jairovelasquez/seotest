**GitHub** is an online, collaborative, cloud-based storage service where developers can share and work on code. It offers free and paid hosting for git repositories that allow us to push our files to a remote host without having to host it ourselves.

There are a few key things we'll explore to be effective users of GitHub:

- We'll go over how to set up a **remote repository** by creating a repository on GitHub and then connecting it to our local repository.

- We'll learn how to **push** changes so we can add our local project files **to the remote repository**.
- Then, we'll explore how to **pull** new or updated files **from the repository** to your local system. 


## GitHub Account
