Now it's time to create¬†a **local repository**. In our case, this will be in our Codio assignment workspace.

## Adding our Remote Repository
Once you are back in Codio... 

- ### Click `Tools` in the menu bar. Hover over `Git` and then select `Remotes...`.

We've already made the remote repository, but a remote repo depends on the information in a local repo. This is why Codio displays a notice about **initializing our repository**. This action creates a local repo on Codio. 

- ### Select `YES` to create your local repository on Codio.

The next page we see is a list of connected remote repositories for this project. Our list is currently empty because our work in Codio is not linked to any remote repositories.

- ### Click on the `ADD REMOTE` button.

Codio then requests a name and URL for the remote. 

![.guides/img/save-remote](.guides/img/save-remote.png)

- ### In the name field type `origin`
- ### In the URL field, paste¬†the ++SSH address++ for our GitHub repository. 
- ### Click `SAVE`

We should now see a list of remotes associated with the directory. The remote name `origin` is listed in bold as well as the SSH URL for the remote. 

- ### Click `CLOSE`
