Let's create a repository on [Github](https://github.com/). 

-  ### Click on the *+* sign in the upper right corner of the screen, and then choose *New Repository*.

- ### Type `gameDevProject` for the name of the repository.

- If GitHub doesn't set your repository to be *public* by default, change it to be *public*. 
  - You shouldn't worry about anyone making changes to your code just because it's in a public repository. Instead, this means that other can see your work. 
  - They can fork the repository to make a copy for themselves, but they cannot change your code.

- ### Click the `Create Repository` button to create the repository.

When the repository is done, GitHub will give it an address. **Be sure to select the SSH address, beginning with `git@github.com:`**.

- ###  Once you've chosen the SSH address, you can copy it by clicking the button on the right. 


We will need this address to link your Codio project to your GitHub repository.
